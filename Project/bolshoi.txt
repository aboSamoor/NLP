==transliteration==

Why not "bolshoy?"  I was of the impression Ð¹ is traditionally transliterated as ''y'', as per pronounciation.  --[[User:NEMT|NEMT]] 02:19, 8 February 2007 (UTC) 

:The website www.bolshoi.ru uniformly spells it with an ''i'' on their English pages; Google reports a slight preponderence for ''y'' on the web as whole. [[User:Robertgreer|Robert Greer]] 16:48, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

==Ballet navigation box==
This article is about a theatre so I don't think a general ballet project navigation box is appropriate here. What do other people think? P.S. I would not be in favour of a general opera box or a general Russia box either. --''[[User:Kleinzach|<span style="color:#FF4500;letter-spacing:2px;">Klein</span>]][[User talk:Kleinzach|<span style="padding:0px 0px 1px 2px;color:white; background-color:#ACE1AF;letter-spacing:2px;">zach</span>]]'' 00:58, 24 December 2008 (UTC)

::Agree with [[User:Kleinzach|Kleinzach]] - not a general ballet article. The tag has been improved but opera houses are not for "ballet" only. It is not suitable to add on a "huge" template of ballet in it - [[User:Whjayg|Jay]] ([[User talk:Whjayg|talk]]) 02:45, 24 December 2008 (UTC)

== Great performers of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] ==

The section on great conductors, singers and dancers is needed. Great singers: Chaliapin, Nezhdanova, Derzhinskaia, Sobinov to name a few. [[User:Semimartingale|Semimartingale]] ([[User talk:Semimartingale|talk]]) 00:24, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

:If you know them and have sources for it, you should definitely add them in.[[User:Meatsgains|Meatsgains]] ([[User talk:Meatsgains|talk]]) 03:01, 29 October 2011 (UTC)
